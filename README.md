# PSX BGAnimations Project

To contribute to this project, make a fork and merge your BGAs so I can check them and add them properly.
If anyone needs help with the structure on how the scripts are called, it goes like this:

  FolderName(default.lua) -> Looks upon actors or sprites (resources) in the Backgrounds/Sprites folder -> and looks too after actual effects on the ParticleEffects folder.
  
  For adding a background that has animated frames, you can use Tool.lua that's in the Backgrounds folder. (it's a bit similar to customtexcoords)
  
  I'm currently developing ParticleEffects so the rest of things to do it's just adding folders and changing resources.
