# BGAnimations Project
PSX Backgrounds Project

Made by Engine_Machiner

Still need to do:

-Change the parameters of all the BGA's.

-Use the new structure system.

-Try to make them look good.

-Try to do some linear "syncing" again or wait until SM5 developers update some way to sync it :/ (Delayed).

-Fix the Glitchy Kaleidoscope Effect.

Any advices will be received.
